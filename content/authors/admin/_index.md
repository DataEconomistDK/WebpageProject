I am a student in economics with a big interest in the appliance of datascience to uncover new knowledge. I have several courses in math, statistics, econometrics, data science, machine learning, NLP.

Other than studying i also work part time at Centrica Energy Trading, assisting the traders as part of the power support team. In me freetime i enjoy sports such as climbing and volleyball, learning about personal development, leadership and financial markets. I also currently use a lot of my time creating events, courses and ect. in the scouts union KFUM spejderne.
